#summary Readme for the Game Announcer
#labels Phase-Deploy

_The Game Announcer is a powerful tool which automatically analyzes and observes the ENT game lobby for you. It notifies you if it detected something and automatically logs it. It also provides some more features to make the moderation easier._

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

=== Notes ===
    * The options _IEerros_ and _IEvisible_ will not be functional if you don't restart the GA. This means: You can change any other options while running the GA and they'll be taken over.
    * (v1.3+) *Supports all kind of games but only for one game name will be filtered.*
    * The ENT pages corrects its data with every second update. If a player joins, his ping is often 0 and his gateway is G/E. Thus, this false information will be taken over by the GA _until_ the page corrects itself with the update.
    * *G/E* means Garena _or_ Econnect. 
    * The page and the GA wont filter corresponding to the slots. If the only player in the lobby is on slot 10, the GA will put him on slot 1 until new players joined.

=== Requirement ===
    * Internet Explorer must be installed (I suggest IE10)
    * (v1.3+) *You must have admin access on [https://entgaming.net/ ENT] to use the tool*

=== Errors ===
|| Your internet connection must be working. || Try to fix the connection or simply restart the GA ||
|| Internet Explorer isn't installed. || If IE isn't installed, do that or if the GA falsely judged that, set IEerror to 1 ||
|| Login failed. || Reasons: Wrong account/Password or no access to the admin site. Might as well be a tech issue - simply restart the tool to fix it. ||
|| Time out! || Loading of the game pages took too long. In that case make manually sure that the ENT page loads correctly. Sometimes, it might be an ENT problem, too. ||

=== Settings ===
*1 means on/enable, 0 means off/disable*
|| Version || Should not be changed or you get an error. ||
|| !AntiSpam || The delay in seconds until the page will be refreshed and filtered again. Should be set to 5 for new/incoming games. ||
|| IEerror || Since the Interent Explorer is needed, the GA will check if it's installed. In case, it errors because it didn't find it, although it's there, set it to 1 to disable the GA's error. The IEerror also shows IE errors since v1.2.3. ||
|| IEvisible || If set to 1, you can see the IE. If set to 0, it's hidden. ||
|| !RefreshDelay || The GA waits for the IE to finish refreshing the site. It's checking every x millisconds when it's done (x = the number you entered). Although, it should work with a pretty low number as well, tests have proven, it's fixing this problem with a higher one. Just test it out yourself. ||
|| Gamename1 || Is the main game with the highest priority. The notification system will only work for this one. ||
|| !AlwaysOnTop2 || Makes the Player Information window always on top by default. ||
|| !UserStatsLink || You can used any link you want which will be opened with the username. ||
|| L_Username || The login username for IE ENT forum. *Don't manually edit this!* ||
|| L_Password || The password for the login. *Don't manually edit this!* ||
|| L_Option || To keep track if you wish to be automatically logged in ||
|| MODmode || Enables the OBS checks ||
|| OBSips || A list of ips for which will be checked (e.g.: 999.22.1,929.11.2) ||
|| OBSsqlip || IPs as [http://www.webdnstools.com/dnstools/ipcalc integer] ||
|| OBScountries || A list of countries to check for (e.g.: Germany) ||
|| OBSname || Names to look for ||
|| OBSstate || The state of the player ||
|| OBScity || GA converts the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_abbreviations ANSI abbreviations] from the ENT page. To filter for them use the GUI city names. Depending on the country, the ENT page might as well contain numbers like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dialling_codes_in_Germany dailling codes], they'll *not* be converted. ||
|| OBSlog || Logs the results in a file ||
|| Whitelist || A list of names for which will not be logged even if his infos contain some from them above ||
|| !GameHistory || Makes a duplicate of the current lobby as a new GUI. Can be useful if you are ingame and would like to have the information of a player without browsing the forums. ||
|| namelist || Disables the alert system for a player once it informed you about him (to avoid mass spamming) ||
|| proxycheck || Enables proxy checking ||
|| Debug || Logs variables' content and shows certain progress steps. (Should only be activated if you encounter errors/bugs.)||

*I strongly recommend to use only parts of the IPs or provider/name because it increases the chance of catching a dodger. However, don't choose keywords like "United States" as country because obviously thousand of players will be logged.*

=== Login GUI ===

|| Login Status ||
|| Starting IE || Starts the Internet Explorer ||
|| IE Check || Checks if the IE installed ||
|| Connection Check || Checks if you are connected to the internet ||
|| Ready || The Login button gets enabled and you can start ||

|| Buttons ||
|| Login || Logs you ins ||
|| _Automatically log me in_ || Saves the username & password and auto-fills the fields with the latest used data ||

=== Buttons ===
|| Stop || Immediately stops the process and resets everything. Also closes the IE. ||
|| Pause/Unpause || Pauses the program. Nothing happens meanwhile and the start hotkey is also disabled. *Note:* After you unpause, everything goes on and the incoming game statistics will most likely be out-dated. Best would be to pause in the anti-spam phase so it goes on with the refreshing after unpausing. ||
|| Toggle Player Information || Can be used to hide/show/recover the window. ||
|| Save Info || Creates a duplicate of the Player Information GUI ||
|| Toggle History || Shows/Hides/Recovers the GUI ||
|| Settings || Opens the settings to edit them ||
|| Log || Opens the log file ||
|| Tray Icon || Double click the tray icon and it hides the main GUI ||

*The Toggle Board and !AlwaysOnTop have been disabled.*

=== Player Information ===

    * You can copy each cell of a row by pressing _Alt_ and the corresponding column number (starting the number 1 for the column _Name_)

    * You can run links (default browser chosen) with the username. Select a line, press ctrl+1 and the link (!UserStatsLink in the settings) will be opened. You've got many possibilities now - depending on your access:
       # stats link
       # use the ENT alias checker
       # use the banlist checker, etc

    * You can make an IP range check (xxx.xxx.xxx. instead of xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) with ctrl+2. Dont forget to select the row to have the correct IP.
   
    * Right click on any line and you copy the current game name
    * If the columns are too big and aren't fully shown in the GUI anymore, you can use your mouse wheel to scroll to the left/right
    * The title contains the current gamename, slot number and corresponding full slot number of the autohosted game, start time (where the GA first seen it), current time and the elapsed time

=== Log ===

Format: 

`[` detection format `]` player gateway IP provider SQLip country state

Detection format: There are six kinds of detection formats. Each OBS option has an own one:
    * VIA ACC
    * VIA PROVIDER
    * VIA IP
    * VIA SQL
    * VIA GEO COUNTRY
    * VIA GEO STATE

You can easily see how the player was detected and you can start investigating with the detected info. This spares you the time to make a full check of every information.

If the name was logged due to _VIA ACC_ and the player also contains parts of OBSprovider, _VIA PROVIDER_ *will not* be logged because it would be doubled then.

=== Proxy Check ===

The proxy checker if enabled (1) uses the following two sources to check for a proxy:
    * http://whatismyipaddress.com/ip-lookup (_VIA PROXY1_)
    * http://www.ip-adress.com/ip_tracer/ (_VIA PROXY2_)

If at least one detected an ip as proxy, it will be logged. However, it doesn't mean it's a 100% valid proxy. Make sure to investigate the case.

The IPs are being saved to avoid mass checking of the same IP which delays the process. However, after a restart, it starts from zero again.

=== Regular Expressions ===

Since v1.3.9 the GA also supports [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression Regular Expressions] (RegEx) which will help to make as detailed search patterns as possible. This section will give some examples on how to use them.

    * Basic wildcard for everything: If you've got a provider called: <199-255-210-21.anchorfree.com>, you can simply modify it for the settings like this: {{[199-255-210-(.*).anchorfree.com]}} and it will match any provider with the ip range and the provider name. Everything between the minus (-) and the provider name (anchorfree) can be random now. Possible matches:
199-255-210-21.anchorfree.com
199-255-210-225.anchorfree.com
199-255-210-125.anchorfree.com

=== How to choose a good gamename? ===

Choosing a good gamename to filter for, you'll first have to find out which gamenames exist. So check out this [https://entgaming.net/forum/games.php site]. As example, I'll use Island Defense. The gamename on the site is: `[`ENT`]` Island Defense #xxx. Since there're not any other gamenames, writing _Island Defense_ in the settings will be enough. However, there're other games like DotA. Simply writing DotA as a gamename won't be enough - it will find the first gamename containing DotA and it might not be the one you wanted.
So check out which DotA gamenames there're. I'll choose a LoD game and a normal one. 
But LoD has 2 modes, so be specific which one you want, either:
    * `[`ENT`]` DotA LoD -sdems6d2 #149
    * `[`ENT`]` DotA LoD -sds6d2 #275

I decided to filter for the second one, so in the settings, you've to write: Gamename=DotA LoD -sds6d2

It's actually pretty simple. GA filters and checks if the line contains the keywords from the settings. 

*But* don't add the slots to the gamenames, neither the gamenumer like #111. `[`ENT`]` doesn't matter since all gamenames have it.

DotA has also many gamenames and since _DotA -apem_ contains _DotA -ap_, how do I filter for _DotA -ap_? Easy! Just make it like that:
DotA -ap *#*

*The pound makes sure the gamename is 100% correct and with this, there can only be one!*

=== Cryptography ===

The Game Announcers use the cryptography from 'Deo' who [http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/67155-ahk-l-crypt-ahk-cryptography-class-encryption-hashing/ published the source code] on !AutoHotkey.net. I am not the owner nor the creater and don't claim any credit for it.

The GA encrypts the username and password input using AES_128 encryption and MD5 hash and writes it to the settings.ini

For the auto-field filling, it reads the strings from the ini and decrypts them for the input only.

=== v1.3 ===

*~* Added code to only add details to the post which are filled out (so no _n/a_ anymore --- *Ban request* only in this version)

*~* Added an option in the settings to enable clearing of all fields (only for *Ban request* in this version)

*+* Added some rules: Refusing to leave the base, Suiciding on purpose and some others I currently can't think off

*~* Changed the pop-up box's (when no proof(s) given) content a little bit to understand easier what the buttons will do

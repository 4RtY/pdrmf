= Start-Up Guide for the DotA Replay Manager Filter =
=== It does not matter which version (ID or DotA) you are using. ===

  * First of all download the DotA Replay Manager here : http://www.mediafire.com/?i4qmz214i50fwfu
  * Secondly, if not already done, download the DotA Replay Manger Filter here : https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/downloads/list

  * After that you can decide if you want to use the ReplaySeeker. The program allows you to increase the fast-forwarding or to slow down the whole stuffs. 

  * So after you got the programs, you open the DotA Replay Manager and then you go to _Settings_ (top left corner) -> _Replay_ (the tab) -> _Write actions to log.txt_ (bottom).

  * Now you can choose a replay. Hit the _Action Log_ tab and press _Load Action_.

  * After the program is ready, you can open the DotA Replay Manager Filter.

  * Choose a desired option and player(s) and start!

  * You can also first run the DRMF and then the DRM via the menu. This reduces the amount of clicks you need to open all the programs.

You are done! Please read the wiki for the ID or DotA to understand all the options.

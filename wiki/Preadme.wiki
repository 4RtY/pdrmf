#summary Readme for the project P

_Secret ENT staff tool for gathering information._

*Readme is currently under construction.*

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

=== Requirements ===
    * Internet Explorer must be installed (I suggest IE10)
    * (v1.3+) *You must have admin access on [https://entgaming.net/ ENT] to use the tool*

=== Errors ===
|| Internet Explorer isn't installed. || If IE isn't installed, do that or if the GA falsely judged that, set IEerror to 1 ||
|| Login failed. || Reasons: Wrong account/Password or no access to the admin site. Might as well be a tech issue - simply restart the tool to fix it. ||
|| Timeout! || Loading of the game pages took too long. In that case make manually sure that the ENT page loads correctly. Sometimes, it might be an ENT problem, too. ||

If you still get a login error, turn IEvisible to 1 and if it annoys you, you can toggle it off later.

=== Cryptography ===
PRISM uses the cryptography from 'Deo' who [http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/67155-ahk-l-crypt-ahk-cryptography-class-encryption-hashing/ published the source code] on !AutoHotkey.net. I am not the owner nor the creater and don't claim any credit for it.

The tool encrypts the username and password input using AES_128 encryption and MD5 hash and writes it to the settings.ini

For the auto-field filling, it reads the strings from the ini and decrypts them for the input only.

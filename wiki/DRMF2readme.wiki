<wiki:toc max_depth="4" />

 
=== General ===
    * Must be used with the latest DotA Replay Manager version (>= 3.02b) 
    * Basically, it contains the *same options* as the version for [https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/wiki/IDreadme Island Defense] and [https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/wiki/DOTAreadme DotA] since both versions are in the DRMF2.
    * Reload now also loads the action log

=== Hotkeys ===
    * Esc to exit the start-up GUI
    * Alt & Esc to exit the ID or DotA GUI
    * Ctrl+f to start the !ResultCrawler

=== Copy _(Result GUI)_ ===
    * Right click on a line in the result gui to copy it. You can also right click twice or more to copy multiple specific lines - it will add them to the clipboard
    * Using ctrl you can actually do the same as with the right click
    * With shift you can copy a whole bunch of lines at once

=== Heroes _(Tab: Click ; Option: Heroes)_ ===
    * If the !DisableException (see settings) is enabled, then each time you use the _heroes_ option, a box will pop-up asking you to enter one or more hero names. The result list will then not contain these hero names. However, you can either press cancel or keep it emty to skip the extra option.
    * Usage example:
      # Juggernaut,Clockwerk Goblin,Death Prophet
      # Juggernaut

=== Settings ===

    * Default _(define wich GUI should start first)_
      # keep it emty or enter a space to start the normal start-up
      # 0 to start the DotA GUI
      # 1 to start the ID GUI
    * !ClearClipboard _(clear before copying result)_
      # 0 to keep the current copied text, plus the copied result lines
      # 1 to clear the clipboard and to only copy the result lines
    * !DisableException _(dis-/enable option for heroes filtering)_
      # 0 to disable the option
      # 1 to enable the option to enter hero name(s) which should not be listed if using the _heroes_ option in the _click_ tab. (The option should help to remove the own user's hero clicks.)

=== Features ===
==== !ResultCrawler ====
Options:
    * [All!] Automatically select all lines containing the keywords
    * [First!] Select the first line with the keywords
    * [None!] Means cancel

     # First an so called inputbox will pop-up for you to enter the keyword(s). Then press either ok or cancel. 
     # Depending on the result (if nothing was found, an info box will pop-up), if something was found, then you'll have 3 options as mentioned above.
     * The hotkey and the feature only work if one of the main GUIs (either ID or DotA) or a Result GUI is *active & topmost*.
     * By default the last result window's content will be searched. However, if you click in another result GUI, it will be taken as the default one.

*+* Added

*-* Removed

*~* Fixed/Changed

*•* Comment/Info

----

== v1.3 __(Not released)__ ==

*~* Modified the result window (now contains the replay name in the colum), plus modified the analyzer and added the game infos to it.

*~* Changed link to download the DRM. (It's now the [https://code.google.com/p/dota-replay-manager/downloads/list project page] and not the mediafire link)

*~* Fixed some bugs
    * Heroes clicks for all & one user won't output an error
    * the 'scourge' & 'sentinel' selection
    * Fixed bug with the result window being in the main GUI if using default option

*~* Playerlist loading function has been rewritten (loads the correct numbers of players (10 for DotA / 11 for ID) in whatever tab you've selected. 

*~* Reload should now load the replay's action log. However, it might happen that you need to press it twice (or manually - working on it to fix it 100%). _(Also made it more flexible for new DRM versions)_

*~* Icons are directly downloaded to the icon folder instead of moving them from the program's folder in the icons folder.
_Added a GUI for icon downloading. Settings, logo and placeholder icons are automatically created by the script without downloading_

*~* Settings
    * Rewrote the tooltip system of the GUI, it hopefully doesn't flicker too much anymore
    * Fixed several things in the settings gui
    * Saving the settings via the settings GUI won't load the DRM log anymore (but via reload button it still does)

*~* Result GUI
    * Listview with details (if there're any)
    * normal analyzer
    * more information in general
    * Added multi specific line copy support (see readme + clearclipboard)

*+* Added the 'clicks-on-heroes' filter an option to add a hero's name which should not be added to the list.
E.g: I want all clicks of the user xyz but then I also get his own hero's clicks listed - entering his hero's name in the inputbox will solve this. (Can be disabled in the settings or the box can be cancelled if it pops up)

*•* Source code increased because of:
    * picture hex code
    * more internal functions

== 22.09.2012 v1.2 ==

*~* Added/Changed lots of details to improve the program's usability.

*~* Changed the whole 'refreshing playerlist' notification system

*~* Fixed refreshing playerlist

*~* [https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/issues/list?can=1&q=&colspec=ID+Summary+Status+Priority+Type+Opened+Modified+Closed+Reporter&cells=tiles Many bug fixes]

*+* Added arial as font for the update GUI (trying to fix the font bug (on ahk's site) which leads to different font sizes on different PCs)

*+* Added item drop/swap to item usage

*+* Added readme menu item which links to the online readme and an offline readme in case the internet is disconnected

*-* Removed worker/harvester from spells

*•* 'Game info' tab does not have to be selected anymore!

== 16.09.2012 v1.1 ==

*~* Fixed and debugged a lot

*~* Fixed for DRM v3.2

== Started on the 27.08.2012 v1.0 -- Based on: DotA v5.1 `|` ID v6.5 ==

*~* Changed the result window

*+* Right clicking on the line in the result window will copy it

*+* Esc to exit the start-up GUI

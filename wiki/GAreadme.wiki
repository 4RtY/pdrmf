=== How to choose a good gamename? ===

Choosing a good gamename to filter for, you'll first have to find out which gamenames exist. So check out this [http://blinkgaming.net/current_games site]. As example, I'll use Island Defense. The gamename on the site is: `<`BGN`>` Island Defense #xxx. Since there're not any other gamenames, writing _Island Defense_ in the settings will be enough. However, there're other games like DotA. Simply writing DotA as a gamename won't be enough - it will find the first gamename containing DotA and it might not be the one you wanted.
So check out which DotA gamenames there're. I'll choose a LoD game and a normal one. 
But LoD has 2 modes, so be specific which one you want, either:
    * `<`BGN`>` DotA LoD -sdems6d2 #149
    * `<`BGN`>` DotA LoD -sds6d2 #275

I decided to filter for the second one, so in the settings, you've to write: GamenameX=DotA LoD -sds6d2 (with x as a number between 1-8)

It's actually pretty simple. GA filters and checks if the line contains the keywords from the settings. 

*But* don't add the slots to the gamenames, neither the gamenumer like #111. `<`BGN`>` doesn't matter since all gamenames have it.

=== Requirement ===
    * Internet Explorer must be installed

=== Settings ===
    * Version : Should not be changed
    * !AntiSpam : The delay in seconds until the page will be refreshed and filtered again. Should be set to 5 for new/incoming games.
    * IEerror : Since the Interent Explorer is needed, the GA will check if it's installed. In case, it errors because it didn't find it, although it's there, set it to 1 to disable the GA's error
    * Gamename1 : Is the main game with the highest priority. The notification system will only work for this one. It still appears on the game board.
    * Gamename2-8 : Are only listed on the board
    * CopyNewGN : The notification system will automatically copy the new gamename of your _Gamename1_ game. If set to 1, it also allows you to copy the gamename by clicking on the traytips (left click)
    * Start, Stop and !TogglePause are the hotkeys for the buttons. Default hotkeys are: *Shift and s* to start, *shift and a* to abort and *shift and b* to pause. The symbol *~* allows it to send the hotkeys else if you press shift+a, only the GA's start function would fire and the hotkey itself keeps blocked.
I highly recommend you reading the page whose link is in the settings (!HotkeyModifier) as well!

_The Game Announcer is a powerful tool which automatically analyzes and observes the ENT game lobby for you. It notifies you if it detected something and automatically logs it. It also provides some more features to make the moderation easier._

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

=== Notes ===
    * The options _IEerros_ and _IEvisible_ will not be functional if you don't restart the GA. This means: You can change any other options while running the GA and they'll be taken over.
    * (v1.3+) *Supports all kind of games but only for one game name will be filtered.*

=== Requirement ===
    * Internet Explorer must be installed (I suggest IE10)
    * (v1.3+) *You must have admin access on [https://entgaming.net/ ENT] to use the tool*

=== Errors ===
|| _Your internet connection must be working_ || Simply reconnect to the internet and try again. ||
|| _The site content could not be accessed_ || No content to filter was found, so the GA will stop and you either restart it or manually check if the ENT site is really down. ||
|| _Internet Explorer doesn't exit anymore_ || Although, the IE is hidden so this can't happend, something must have closed the IE process. The GA stops and you can decide to restart it, so a new instance of the IE will be started. ||
|| _I am not getting any results._ || Either the ENT site for the games is different/new, down/not working or your configuration is false. ||
|| _Error. Re-log!_ || Seems like you stopped the filtering and wanted to restart it. You'll have to restart the GA completely. It might also be that you don't have admin access to the site. ||

*Rarely*, the site content error can lead to a temporarily malfunction of the IE which leads to other weird errors. But simply restarting the GA solves everything. Once again, this error might only appear after very long usage or other unknown problems with the IE & GA.

=== Settings ===
*1 means on/enable, 0 means off/disable*
|| Version || Should not be changed or you get an error. ||
|| !AntiSpam || The delay in seconds until the page will be refreshed and filtered again. Should be set to 5 for new/incoming games. ||
|| IEerror || Since the Interent Explorer is needed, the GA will check if it's installed. In case, it errors because it didn't find it, although it's there, set it to 1 to disable the GA's error. The IEerror also shows IE errors since v1.2.3. ||
|| IEvisible || If set to 1, you can see the IE. If set to 0, it's hidden. ||
|| !RefreshDelay || The GA waits for the IE to finish refreshing the site. It's checking every x millisconds when it's done (x = the number you entered). Although, it should work with a pretty low number as well, tests have proven, it's fixing this problem with a higher one. Just test it out yourself. ||
|| !DisableSound || If set to 1, it disables the sound on new/incoming games and the warning message of MODmode. ||
|| Gamename1 || Is the main game with the highest priority. The notification system will only work for this one. It still appears on the game board. ||
|| !AlwaysOnTop2 || Makes the Player Information window always on top by default. ||
|| !UserStatsLink || You can used any link you want which will be opened with the username. ||
|| L_Username || The login username for IE ENT forum. *Don't manually edit this!* ||
|| L_Password || The password for the login. *Don't manually edit this!* ||
|| L_Option || To keep track if you wish to be automatically logged in ||
|| IncGUI || Enables the Player Information board. *Must be _1_ for the program to work.* ||
|| MODmode || Enables the OBS checks ||
|| OBSips || A list of ips for which will be checked (e.g.: 999.22.1,929.11.2) ||
|| OBSsqlip || IPs as [http://www.webdnstools.com/dnstools/ipcalc integer] ||
|| OBScountries || A list of countries to check for (e.g.: Germany) ||
|| OBSname || Names to look for ||
|| OBSstate || The state of the player ||
|| OBSlog || Logs the results in a file ||

The OBS check will only work if the MODmode is enabled (1). The MODmode will only work if IncGUI is enabled (1).

*I strongly recommend to use only parts of the IPs or provider/name because it increases the chance of catching a dodger. However, don't choose keywords like "United States" as country because obviously thousand of players will be logged.*

=== Buttons ===
|| Start || The start function will first check if the IE is installed, then if you are connected to the internet. It then navigates to the site. ||
|| Stop || Immediately stops the process and resets everything. Also closes the IE. ||
|| Pause/Unpause || Pauses the program. Nothing happens meanwhile and the start hotkey is also disabled. *Note:* After you unpause, everything goes on and the incoming game statistics will most likely be out-dated. Best would be to pause in the anti-spam phase so it goes on with the refreshing after unpausing. ||
|| Toggle Player Information || Can be used to hide/show/recover the window. ||
|| Settings || Opens the settings to edit them ||
|| Log || Opens the log file ||

*The Toggle Board and !AlwaysOnTop have been disabled.*

=== Player Information ===
    * To enable it, set IncGUI=1 in the settings.

    * You can copy each cell of a row by pressing _Alt_ and the corresponding column number (Column _Name_ = 1)

    * You run links (default browser chosen) with the username. Select a line, press ctrl+1 and the link (!UserStatsLink in the settings) will be opened. You've got many possibilities now - depending on your access:
       # stats link
       # use the ENT alias checker
       # use the banlist checker, etc
   
    * Right click on any line and you copy the current game name
    * If the columns are too big and aren't fully shown in the GUI anymore, you can use your mouse wheel to scroll to the left/right
    * The title contains the current gamename, slot number and corresponding full slot number of the autohosted game, start time (where the GA first seen it), current time and the elapsed time

=== How to choose a good gamename? ===

Choosing a good gamename to filter for, you'll first have to find out which gamenames exist. So check out this [https://entgaming.net/forum/games.php site]. As example, I'll use Island Defense. The gamename on the site is: `[`ENT`]` Island Defense #xxx. Since there're not any other gamenames, writing _Island Defense_ in the settings will be enough. However, there're other games like DotA. Simply writing DotA as a gamename won't be enough - it will find the first gamename containing DotA and it might not be the one you wanted.
So check out which DotA gamenames there're. I'll choose a LoD game and a normal one. 
But LoD has 2 modes, so be specific which one you want, either:
    * `[`ENT`]` DotA LoD -sdems6d2 #149
    * `[`ENT`]` DotA LoD -sds6d2 #275

I decided to filter for the second one, so in the settings, you've to write: Gamename=DotA LoD -sds6d2

It's actually pretty simple. GA filters and checks if the line contains the keywords from the settings. 

*But* don't add the slots to the gamenames, neither the gamenumer like #111. `[`ENT`]` doesn't matter since all gamenames have it.

DotA has also many gamenames and since _DotA -apem_ contains _DotA -ap_, how do I filter for _DotA -ap_? Easy! Just make it like that:
DotA -ap *#*

*The pound makes sure the gamename is 100% correct and with this, there can only be one!*

=== Cryptography ===

The Game Announcers use the cryptography from 'Deo' who [http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/67155-ahk-l-crypt-ahk-cryptography-class-encryption-hashing/ published the source code] on !AutoHotkey.net. I am not the owner nor the creater and don't claim any credit for it.

The GA encrypts the username and password input using AES_128 encryption and MD5 hash and writes it to the settings.ini

For the auto-field filling, it reads the strings from the ini and decrypts them for the input only.

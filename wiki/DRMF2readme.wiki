<wiki:toc max_depth="4" />

*Contains options & features of the current developed version.*

=== General ===
    * Must be used with the latest DotA Replay Manager version (>= 3.02b) 
    * Basically, it contains the *same options* as the version for [https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/wiki/IDreadme Island Defense] and [https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/wiki/DOTAreadme DotA] since both versions are in the DRMF2.
    * Reload loads only the settings

*Start-UP:* [https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/wiki/StartUpGuide here]

=== Hotkeys ===
    * Esc to exit the start-up GUI
    * Alt & Esc to exit the ID or DotA GUI
    * Ctrl+f to start the !ResultCrawler
    * Ctrl+r to remove result lines
    * Alt+c to toggle macro on/off

Since you can edit the hotkeys in the settings GUI, the hotkeys are meanwhile disabled until
    # you exit the gui (current one)
    # save the settings (new one)
    # erase the settings (default one)
and newly added to their functions.

=== Copy _(Result GUI)_ ===
    * Right click on a line in the result gui to copy it. You can also right click twice or more to copy multiple specific lines - it will add them to the clipboard
    * Using ctrl you can actually do the same as with the right click
    * With shift you can copy a whole bunch of lines at once

=== Heroes _(Tab: Click ; Option: Heroes)_ ===
    * If the !DisableException (see settings) is enabled, then each time you use the _heroes_ option, a box will pop-up asking you to enter one or more hero names. The result list will then not contain these hero names. However, you can either press cancel or keep it emty to skip the extra option.
    * Usage example:
      # Juggernaut,Clockwerk Goblin,Death Prophet
      # Juggernaut

=== !HackCheck _(Tab: Miscs ; Option: !HackCheck)_ ===

    * *The hack check option does not find fog clicks for you _except_ for Island Defense (clicks at 0:09)!*
    * The option searches for key words triggered by off line hacks, trade hack and the mentioned click in Island Defense which is always 100% proof of maphack.
    * The option can be used with every other option as well, by default the result is a combination of the user's actionlog (like if you ticked off nothing) and the hack check result. If nothing was found, the _>>> Hack Check Result <<<_ line won't appear.
    * Suggestions on 100% fog clicks in either DotA or Island Defense are always welcome because at the moment, it's only useful for Island Defense.

=== Settings ===

    * Default _(define wich GUI should start first)_
      # keep it emty or enter a space to start the normal start-up
      # 0 to start the DotA GUI
      # 1 to start the ID GUI
    * !ClearClipboard _(clear before copying result)_
      # 0 to keep the current copied text, plus the copied result lines
      # 1 to clear the clipboard and to only copy the result lines
If enabled it will also clear the clipboard each time a new filter GUI was initiated. This means, if there're already 2 windows opened, then you can cross-copy lines of both windows because the clipboard isn't cleared.
    * !DisableException _(dis-/enable option for heroes filtering)_
      # 0 to disable the option
      # 1 to enable the option to enter hero name(s) which should not be listed if using the _heroes_ option in the _click_ tab. (The option should help to remove the own user's hero clicks.)

=== Features ===
==== !ResultCrawler ====
*• ctrl+f :: Options:*
    * `[`All`]` Automatically select all lines containing the keywords
    * `[`First`]` Select the first line with the keywords
    * `[`None`]` Means cancel
 
     # First an so called input box will pop-up for you to enter the keyword(s). Then press either ok or cancel. 
     # Depending on the result (if nothing was found, an info box will pop-up), if something was found, then you'll have 3 options as mentioned above.

*• ctrl+r :: Options:*
    * `[`All`]` Automatically removes all lines (button doesn't exist - it's the default option)
    # Simply enter keywords and the lines containing them will be removed.


     * Both pop-up windows can be cancelled via button or esc
     * The !ResultCrawler will only work if a result GUI *exists* and *topmost*.
     * By default the last result window's content will be searched. However, if you click in another result GUI, it will be taken as the default one.

==== !EnemyClickChecker ====
*• Syntax, description and exmaples*
    * c u (check `<`user`>`)

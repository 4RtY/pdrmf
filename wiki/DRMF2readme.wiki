= !ReadMe for the merged DotA Replay Manager Filter =


=== Must be used with the latest DotA Replay Manager verion (3.02b) ===
=== The 'Game info' tab has to be open if refreshing the list or before starting the program. This might be fixed in the future. ===

    * Basicaly, it contains the *same options* as the version for [Island Defense  https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/wiki/IDreadme] and [DotA https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/wiki/DOTAreadme] since both versions are in the DRMF2.
    * Esc to exit the start-up GUI
    * Alt & Esc to exit the ID or DotA GUI
    * Right-click on a line in the result GUI to copy it
    * Change the setting 'Default' to:
      # 1 for starting ID instead of the start-up
      # 0 for starting DotA instead of the start-up
      # emty for starting start-up
    * Reload now also loads the action log (so you don't need to press 2 tabs)

#summary Readme for the Game Crawler

_The Game Crawler offers two options: Firstly, to scan through replays in your folder and secondly, to download replays from a specific genre and check through them._

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

=== Requirement ===
    * Internet Explorer must be installed (I suggest IE10)
    * You must have admin access on [https://entgaming.net/ ENT] to use the tool.

=== Note ===

    * Only official replays from ENT are currently supported. Means: The files must consist of digits.
    * The qlog.exe will popup multiple times after each other. If you scan > 10 games, you shouldn't be playing games while doing this.

=== How to start ===

    # Start the tool (files will be created).
    # Edit the settings with [https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/wiki/GCtriggers triggers] and press the reload tab.
    # Start. 

=== Settings ===

||Version||Your current version.||
||Debug||Logs tool's actions for solo user. (1)||
||Gamenames||List to choose a genre from (can be edited).||
||Size||Font size of the result.||
||triggers2||Raw filtering||
||triggers||Fine filtering (first the second one, then this one)||
||L_Option||Save login data||
||!AutoLogin||Login if data in settings||
||L_Username||Forum account. *Do not edit*||
||L_Password||Forum password. *Do not edit*||
||IEerror || Since the Interent Explorer is needed, the GA will check if it's installed. In case, it errors because it didn't find it, although it's there, set it to 1 to disable the GA's error. The IEerror also shows IE errors since v1.2.3. ||
|| IEvisible || If set to 1, you can see the IE. If set to 0, it's hidden. ||
||Warning||Shows the qlog.exe warning (1) or disables it (0).||
||!ReplayPath||Will be overwritten each time to save it for the next time.||

=== Index ===

The Index is a number which defines the amount of games to scan/download.
By default, 200 games (maximum anyway) will be checked for. If you define the maximum to 20, only 20 will be d&s.

The same applies to the off-line scanning from which the maximum is defined by the amount of .w3g files in the chosen folder.

The Index value can also be changed _while_ the qlog.exe process is running. This means, you can either use *Abort* (tab) to stop the whole scanning or you change the _Index_ to set a new maximum.

=== How to save multiple triggers ===

You can only have multiple triggers by writing them in a list
{{{
triggers=flags=76,flags=68,flags=60
}}}
However, you can add a symbol (#) in front of it to save it and use something else. It is probably the best way to do it.
{{{
#triggers=flags=76,flags=68,
triggers=0x000D020A,
}}}

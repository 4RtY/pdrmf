=== How to choose a good gamename? ===

Choosing a good gamename to filter for, you'll first have to find out which gamenames exist. So check out this [http://blinkgaming.net/current_games site]. As example, I'll use Island Defense. The gamename on the site is: `<`BGN`>` Island Defense #xxx. Since there're not any other gamenames, writing _Island Defense_ in the settings will be enough. However, there're other games like DotA. Simply writing DotA as a gamename won't be enough - it will find the first gamename containing DotA and it might not be the one you wanted.
So check out which DotA gamenames there're. I'll choose a LoD game and a normal one. 
But LoD has 2 modes, so be specific which one you want, either:
    * `<`BGN`>` DotA LoD -sdems6d2 #149
    * `<`BGN`>` DotA LoD -sds6d2 #275

I decided to filter for the second one, so in the settings, you've to write: GamenameX=DotA LoD -sds6d2 (with x as a number between 1-8)

It's actually pretty simple. GA filters and checks if the line contains the keywords from the settings. 

*But* don't add the slots to the gamenames, neither the gamenumer like #111. `<`BGN`>` doesn't matter since all gamenames have it.

=== Requirement ===
    * Internet Explorer must be installed

=== Settings ===
    * Version : Should not be changed
    * !AntiSpam : The delay in seconds until the page will be refreshed and filtered again. Should be set to 5 for new/incoming games.
    * IEerror : Since the Interent Explorer is needed, the GA will check if it's installed. In case, it errors because it didn't find it, although it's there, set it to 1 to disable the GA's error
    * Gamename1 : Is the main game with the highest priority. The notification system will only work for this one. It still appears on the game board.
    * Gamename2-8 : Are only listed on the board
    * CopyNewGN : The notification system will automatically copy the new gamename of your _Gamename1_ game. If set to 1, it also allows you to copy the gamename by clicking on the traytips (left click)
    * Start, Stop and !TogglePause are the hotkeys for the buttons. Default hotkeys are: *Shift and s* to start, *shift and a* to abort and *shift and b* to pause. The symbol *~* allows it to send the hotkeys else if you press shift+a, only the GA's start function would fire and the hotkey itself keeps blocked.
I highly recommend you reading the page whose link is in the settings (!HotkeyModifier) as well!

=== Buttons ===
    * Start : The start function will first check if the IE is installed, then if you are connected to the internet. After that, the IE will be started (in the background) and navigated to _http://blinkgaming.net/current_games_. It then starts with the anti-spam, refreshing of the site and filtering. This goes on in a loop.
    * Stop : Immediately stops the process and resets everything. Also closes the IE.
    * Pause/Unpause : Pauses the program. Nothing happens meanwhile and the start hotkey is also disabled. *Note:* After you unpause, everything goes on and the incoming game statistics will most likely be out-dated. Best would be to pause in the anti-spam phase so it goes on with the refreshing after unpausing.
    * Toggle Board : Can be used to hide/show/recover (after closing it) the board.

=== Game board ===
    * In the case a gamename wasn't found, it's line (same as the gamename number. E.g. Gamename1 is Island Defense, so Island Defense will also be in the first line) will be emty.
    * By right clicking on a line, the gamename will be copied, except it's emty.
    * By closing it, you never really exit it. Use the button _Toggle Board_ to get it back.

*•* Comment/Info

----

== v1.3 __(Not released)__ ==

*~* Fixed some bugs
    * Heroes clicks for all & one user won't output an error

*~* Playerlist loading function has been rewritten (loads the correct numbers of players (10 for DotA / 11 for ID) in whatever tab you've selected. 

*~* Same for the reload button. However, you might have to press it twice if it's the first replay of the day you are loading.
_(Also made it more flexible for new DRM versions)_

*~* Icons are directly downloaded to the icon folder instead of moving them from the program's folder in the icons folder.
    * _Added a GUI for icon downloading. Settings, logo and placeholder icons are automatically created by the script without downloading_

*~* Settings
    * Rewrote the tooltip system of the GUI, it hopefully doesn't flicker too much anymore

    * Fixed several things in the settings gui

    * Saving the settings via the settings GUI won't load the DRM log anymore (but via reload button it still does)

*+* Added multi specific line copy support (see readme + clearclipboard)

*+* Added the 'clicks-on-heroes' filter an option to add a hero's name which should not be added to the list.
    * E.g: I want all clicks of the user xyz but then I also get his own hero's clicks listed - entering his hero's name in the inputbox will solve this.

*•* Source code increased because of:
    * picture hex code
    * more internal functions

== 22.09.2012 v1.2 ==

*~* Added/Changed lots of details to improve the program's usability.

*~* [https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/issues/list?can=1&q=&colspec=ID+Summary+Status+Priority+Type+Opened+Modified+Closed+Reporter&cells=tiles Many bug fixes]

*+* Added arial as font for the update GUI (trying to fix the font bug (on ahk's site) which leads to different font sizes on different PCs)

= !ReadMe for the merged DotA Replay Manager Filter =


=== Must be used with the latest DotA Replay Manager verion (3.02b) ===

=== Contains parts for v1.3 ===

    * Basicaly, it contains the *same options* as the version for [https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/wiki/IDreadme Island Defense] and [https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/wiki/DOTAreadme DotA] since both versions are in the DRMF2.
    * Esc to exit the start-up GUI
    * Alt & Esc to exit the ID or DotA GUI
    * Right-click on a line in the result GUI to copy it (use shift or ctrl to select more lines)
    * Change the setting 'Default' to:
      # 1 for starting ID instead of the start-up
      # 0 for starting DotA instead of the start-up
      # emty for starting start-up
    * Reload now also loads the action log
    * Change clearclipboard in the settings to 1 to clear it before copying a line or keep it 0 to not delete the clipboard before copying the line(s)
    * Forgot to mention that the saving of the settings automatically loads the settings again, no need for the reload button
    * Change the disableexception setting to 1 to enable the option of filtering all clicks of the user(s) on heroes (in general - 'clicks' tab) but without the inputed name. Helpful to disable the hero of the user himself

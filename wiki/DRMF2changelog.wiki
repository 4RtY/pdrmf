=== 31.05.2013 v1.5.2 ===

*•* The size of the exe increases because:
    * new off-line readme text
    * new hax codes for images
    * new code

*~* [https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/issues/list?can=1&q=%5BDRMF2%5D+v1.5.1&colspec=ID+Summary+Status+Priority+Type+Opened+Modified+Closed&cells=tiles General list of bug fixes and changes in v1.5.2]

*~* Improved the commands filter. Filters now for bot commands and game commands (>>> Bot commands <<<, >>> Game commands <<<). Bot commands with the trigger _!_

*~* Changed the first time install GUI (fixes the font size bug) and fixed 2 icons not to be created with icon downloader

*~* Fixed many little bugs related to the log path

*~* Fixed hero typos which caused empty results:

   * Ancient Apparition
   * Lord of Olympus
   * Death Prophet
   * Goblin Shredder
   * Guardian Wisp

_Credits to beta tester._

*~* Fixed some things with the exit behavior of the settings gui after install

*~* Fixed the scroll issue not showing all lines except if you maximize/resize the window.

*~* Completely changed off-line readme (with most important stuffs in it)

*~* Improved the playerlist refreshing algorithm again but it might happen that you yourself aren't listed in the list because you left the game and the replay doesn't save that message in very rare and specific cases. - I am working very often on the algorithm to improve it. If you got a replay for which the playerlist doesn't work, please *send it to me*! Thank you.

*~* If copying an information of the _no result window_, you'll only get the text of the second column.

*~* Fixed the syncfree option. It now also removes the 0x62 Triggers. (Syncfree: Line1 gets stored, Line2 gets stored; If Line1 = Line2, take only one.)

*+* Added name support for spoofers

*~*/*+* !EnemyClickChecker got a whole new change with major improvements
    * *~* ECC GUI completely changed
    * *+* Added parameter 's' to the !EnemeyClickChecker (starting point; see readme)
    * *+* Added parameter 'e' to only filter clicks on the enemy heroes

*+* Since the links in the update GUI don't work (for whatever reason), I've added an extra GUI which enables you to copy the links.

*+* Added a prompt to ask for *administrative rights* for updating/downloading icons if the user isn't already logged in with these rights. `[`Required to access the internet!`]` - Each time you start it. There's at least one positive aspect: There isn't a prompt if you start the Replay Seeker via the menu.

*+* _Clicks on ground_ in the _Clicks_ tab now also search for item ground selections.

*+* Added cheat detection (*see [https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/wiki/DRMF2readme?ts=1359728893&updated=DRMF2readme#HackCheck__(Tab:_Miscs_;_Option:_HackCheck_) readme]*)

*+* With a double click on the tray icon, you can toggle the windows (either minimize them or maximize). This also works for the Start-Up. The option can also be triggered via right click on the tray icon and then selecting it.

*-* The autohotkey pop up box asking you to replace the old instance of the program with a new one won't appear anymore

*-* Removed the !CordCalc for DotA and removed !TimeCalc for ID menu

=== 24.12.2012 v1.5.1 ===

*~* [https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/issues/list?can=1&q=id%3A90%2C91%2C92%2C93%2C94%2C95%2C96&colspec=ID+Summary+Status+Priority+Type+Opened+Modified+Closed&cells=tiles Fixes] in general

*+* Added drag and drop (see [https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/wiki/DRMF2readme readme])

*+* Added _Update_ back to the menues in case someone uses the instant GUIs instead of start-up

*~* Improved the playerlist algorithm which now compiles the list to 99% (before there were cases that a keyword didn't appear which stopped the process).

*~* Fixed the default option (was only bugged in v1.4+)

*~* Fixed the update process which didn't trigger the startup GUI after the update

*~* Fixed the startup to now appear after setting up the config in the first install process

*~* Fixed the miscellaneous submenu to have doubled items (GUI ID *&* GUI DotA)

*~* !VersionCheck.ini is now hidden

*~* Modifier hotkey link in the settings (tab: hotkeys) has been changed to a more detailed one

=== 29.11.2012 v1.5 ===

*~* Some [https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/issues/list?can=1&q=v1.4&colspec=ID+Summary+Status+Priority+Type+Opened+Modified+Closed+Reporter&cells=tiles changes & bug fixes]

*~* Fixed c-macro

*~* Changed menu to: 
    * DotA Replay Manager
    * !ReplaySeeker
    * Tools
      # EEC
      # !TimeCalc
      # !CoordCalc
    * Miscellaneous
      # ID/DotA GUI
      # Messenger
      # Readme
    * Settings

*+* Added the possibility to change the hotkeys (search, delete, macro, esc(startup)) in the settings for your own needs.

*+* Added ctrl+r to remove lines containing keywords; For both ctrl+f/r will be given a traytip with the amount of found/removed lines

*+* Added two links which will help you to use the full hotkey customizing power of !AutoHotkey

*-* Reload button will *only* reload the settings. I just realized that it's not needed to press the action log because once selected/double clicked the replay in the DRM, the log gets filled with the raw code.

*-* Removed EEC from ID menu

==== Alpha 1.4.2 ====

*~* Fixed playerlist for ID

==== Alpha 1.4.1 ==== 

*•* Hotfix due to the playerlist

=== 23.10.2012 v1.4 ===

*~* Fixed the not working playerlist for DotA

*~* [https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/issues/list?can=1&q=v1.3%20status=Verified&colspec=ID%20Summary%20Status%20Priority%20Type%20Opened%20Modified%20Closed%20Reporter Some] changes & bug fixes

*~* The _!MoveFilter_ option has been renamed to _MoveGUIs_ as it now also moves the DRM if opened via the menu.

*+* Added '!ResultCrawler' (see [https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/wiki/DRMF2readme readme])

*-* Removed the debugging ctrl+d hotkey which presses the load button in the DRM (forgot to remove)

=== 10.10.2012 v1.3 ===

*•* Will be compiled as x32 for x32 users - x64 can use it anyway

*~* Changed link to download the DRM. (It's now the [https://code.google.com/p/dota-replay-manager/downloads/list project page] and not the mediafire link)

*~* [https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/issues/list?can=1&q=v1.2&colspec=ID+Summary+Status+Priority+Type+Opened+Modified+Closed+Reporter&cells=tiles Fixed some bugs]
    * Heroes clicks for all & one user won't output an error
    * the 'scourge' & 'sentinel' selection
    * Fixed bug with the result window being in the main GUI if using default option
    * Fixed the typo with the private option and another option not causing an analyzer problem
    * Fixed specific hero listing

*~* Playerlist loading function has been rewritten (loads the correct numbers of players (10 for DotA / 11 for ID) in whatever tab you've selected. 

*~* Reload should now load the replay's action log. However, it might happen that you need to press it twice (or manually - working on it to fix it 100%). _(Also made it more flexible for new DRM versions)_

    It also depends on the DRM itself - you've to choose the replay correctly so even it's playerlist refreshes and the DRMF can recognize the new loaded replay. Also, you shouldn't load too many replays in a very short time. If you are using the DRM calmly like everyone else than you shouldn't have any problems. However, no 100% guarantee.

*~* Icons are directly downloaded to the icon folder instead of moving them from the program's folder in the icons folder.
_Added a GUI for icon downloading. Settings, logo and placeholder icons are automatically created by the script without downloading_

*~* Settings
    * Rewrote the tooltip system of the GUI, it hopefully doesn't flicker too much anymore
    * Fixed several things in the settings gui
    * Saving the settings via the settings GUI won't load the DRM log anymore (but via reload button it still does)

*~* Result GUI
    * Listview with details (if there're any)
    * normal analyzer
    * more information in general
    * Added multi specific line copy support
    * If clearclipboard option is enabled, the clipboard will be cleared after each 'Filter' pressing. So it's ready for the new result content (_but copying multiple times in the same result window won't trigger the clearing_)

*+* Added the 'clicks-on-heroes' filter an option to add a hero's name which should not be added to the list.
E.g: I want all clicks of the user xyz but then I also get his own hero's clicks listed - entering his hero's name in the inputbox will solve this. (Can be disabled in the settings or the box can be cancelled if it pops up)

=== 22.09.2012 v1.2 ===

*~* Added/Changed lots of details to improve the program's usability.

*~* Changed the whole 'refreshing playerlist' notification system

*~* Fixed refreshing playerlist

*+* Added item drop/swap to item usage

*+* Added readme menu item which links to the online readme and an offline readme in case the internet is disconnected

*-* Removed worker/harvester from spells

*•* 'Game info' tab does not have to be selected anymore!

=== 16.09.2012 v1.1 ===

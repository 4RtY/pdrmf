=== Using the DRMF2 for the very first time ===
    # First of all [https://code.google.com/p/dota-replay-manager/downloads/list download] the DotA Replay Manager
    # Secondly, if not already done, [https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/downloads/list download] the DotA Replay Manager Filter 2 [DRMF2]
    # If you want, you can also [http://dotasecrets.wordpress.com/latest-downloads/softwares/replay-parsers/replay-seeker/ download] the replayseeker which allows you to fast-forward (or slowing down) the replay (optinal).
    # After you downloaded everything start the DRM and go to the settings, choose the tab Replay and tick the "Log actions to log.txt" box at the bottom.
    # Then choose a replay and press the "Action log" tab and then load an action log via pressing "Load"
# This is needed to create the log.txt which is needed to start the DRMF2
    # So now start the DRMF2.exe and configurate the settings, choose the log.txt path which was just created
    # After saving it, the program should start. Now you can choose a desired option and a player
    # Press "Filter" in the DRMF2 to start

=== Note: ===
All the steps above aren't needed for the second time (if you haven't deleted the log.txt). You now have two different ways of reaching your goal, however, starting the DRMF2 first would save you browsing through your folders to start the DRM.

* Starting the DRM first:
# Choose a replay
# Start the DRMF2 (it will now load the playerlist)
# Press load in the DRMF2 to load the action log (so you don't need to choose the tab and the button of the DRM)
# Choose the desired option and profit

* Starting the DRMF2 first:
# Start the DRM (via menu)
# Choose a replay
# Press Refresh Playerlist
# Press Reload
# Choose the desired option and profit

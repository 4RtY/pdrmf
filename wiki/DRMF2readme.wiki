= !ReadMe for the merged DotA Replay Manager Filter =


=== - Must be used with the latest DotA Replay Manager version (>= 3.02b) ===

    * Basically, it contains the *same options* as the version for [https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/wiki/IDreadme Island Defense] and [https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/wiki/DOTAreadme DotA] since both versions are in the DRMF2.
    * Esc to exit the start-up GUI
    * Alt & Esc to exit the ID or DotA GUI
=== • Copy ===
    * Right click on a line in the result gui to copy it. You can also right click twice or more to copy multiple specific lines - it will add them to the clipboard
    * Using ctrl you can actually do the same as with the right click
    * With shift you can copy a whole bunch of lines at once
=== • Heroes _(Tab: Click ; Option: Heroes)_ ===

    * Reload now also loads the action log
    * Saving the settings via the settings GUI won't load the gamechat anymore
    * If chosen the heroes option in the _click_ tab and the input box is enabled, you can enter more than one hero name as long as you do it like this:
      # Juggernaut,Clockwerk Goblin,Death Prophet
      # Juggernaut
    Pressing cancel will lists the normal result; pressing Ok without entering something (input is emty), it will also show the normal result


== Settings ==

    * Default _(define wich GUI should start first)_
      # keep it emty or enter a space to start the normal start-up
      # 0 to start the DotA GUI
      # 1 to start the ID GUI
    * !ClearClipboard _(clear before copying result)_
      # 0 to keep the current copied text, plus the copied result lines
      # 1 to clear the clipboard and to only copy the result lines
    * !DisableException _(dis-/enable option for heroes filtering)_
      # 0 to disable the option
      # 1 to enable the option to enter hero name(s) which should not be listed if using the _heroes_ option in the _click_ tab. (The option should help to remove the own user's hero clicks.)

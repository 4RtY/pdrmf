#summary Readme for the Replay Seeker Watcher
<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

_The Replay Seeker Watcher stops the Replay Seeker in case it bugs again. This means: if the seeker forwards behind the given time, the watcher will stop it._

=== How to use it ===
    * First start the Replay Seeker, enter a time and click sync
    * Then start the watcher and you are done.

The tool will automatically exit if:
    # the seeker isn't started
    # no time is given _or_ the time has already been reached
    # after the sync is over

=== Hotkeys ===
|| Esc || Exits the tool ||

=== Known Bugs ===

Since the tool isn't that important, certain bugs won't be fixed.
    * If the replay seeker doesn't exist, the message box pops up two times.
    * If the tool version is higher than the settings' version, nothing happens.
    * Rarely, even the RSW doesn't stop the RS.

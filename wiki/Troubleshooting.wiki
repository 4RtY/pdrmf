#Summary Troubleshooting for the DRMF(2)

== DotA Replay Manager Filter Bugs & Known Problems ==

=== Compatibility ===
  * DRMF ID (v6.5) only compatible with win7 x32
  * DRMF DotA (v5.1) only compatible with win7 x32
  * DRMF2 (v >= 1.3) compatible with win7 x32 & x64 and probably with the rest, too 

=== Update & Download ===
  * The DRMF2 needs access to the internet to update or download icons. If you aren't logged in with administrative rights, please run the DRMF2 as admin to allow it accessing the internet. If you are already logged in as admin, you can try it as well but it's more likely your internet connection being down.

In case you still experience problems, please email me _<ProjectDRMF@gmail.com>_.

#summary ReadMe for the merged DotA Replay Manager Filter
<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

=== General notes ===
    * Due to the tons of DotA hotkeys, it's not smart to have both ID and DotA hotkeys in one customkeys.txt, so please keep them separated.
    * Each time you change a hotkey, you'll need to restart Warcraft 3 to make them work.
    * Don't forget to activate customhotkeys in the Wc3 options.
    * The !DefenseKeys tool does not check for multiple same hotkeys on one unit.
    * You've to save each edit you are doing with the save button. Selecting a new spell/builder without saving makes them voided.

=== Modification restrictions ===
    * You can edit the hotkey, unhotkey, researchhotkey and the tip. Please note to remove or change the hotkey tip else it might confuse you.
    * You shouldn't modify the !CustomKeys.txt due to the syntax. However, if there's an update, you can open the file and paste it in.

=== Concerning Spells ===
    * Some spells have the same spell ID like the teleport of Murloc, Makura and Gnoll. Due to this, you can't edit them in the section of those builders but as an own spell. This also means that you can't have 3 different hotkeys for the spell for these 3 builders.
    * However, some spells, although they're the same, have different spell IDs. Like all the panic spells - so you can give each of them a different hotkey.
    * As mentioned, some spells have the same ID so a lot of builder share this same spell (like gathering wood) - however, some other builders, although having the same spell, have a different spell ID.
To sum this up: At the beginning of a game, make sure the hotkeys are working correctly.

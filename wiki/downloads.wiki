=== Google's statement ===

_"Existing projects with downloads will see no visible changes until January 14, 2014 and will no longer have the ability to create new downloads starting on January 15, 2014."_

=== Where can I download the tools now? ===
I'll upload the tools via google drive. You can download them from there.

=== Update Info? ===

You'll not receive any update information for the new tools. I'll remove all version check files to avoid version problems in the future.

= Start-Up Guide for the DotA Replay Manager Filter =
* • It does not matter which version (ID, DotA or DRMF2) you are using but since I still had this pictures, I used it as an example.

• The guide isn't up-to-date anymore, however, the concept is the same except for some steps which aren't needed anymore.*

----

  * First of all download the DotA Replay Manager [https://code.google.com/p/dota-replay-manager/downloads/list here]
  * Secondly, if not already done, download the DotA Replay Manger Filter [https://code.google.com/p/pdrmf/downloads/list here]

  * After that you can decide if you want to use the !ReplaySeeker. The program allows you to increase the fast-forwarding or to slow down the whole stuffs. 

  * So after you got the programs, you open the DotA Replay Manager and then you go to _Settings_ (top left corner) -> _Replay_ (the tab) -> _Write actions to log.txt_ (bottom).

  * Now you can choose a replay. Hit the _Action Log_ tab and press _Load Action_. It will look like:

  * After the program is ready, you can open the DotA Replay Manager Filter.

  * Choose a desired option and player(s) and start! So it looks like:

  * Now you can use the !ReplaySeeker. Check the time where the user clicked on an object and put the time in the ReplaySeeker (don't forget to reduce it by some seconds, so you get the time to take the position of the clicking player)

  * You can also first run the DRMF and then the DRM via the menu. This reduces the amount of clicks you need to open all the programs.

You are done! Please read the wiki for the ID or DotA to understand all the options.

<wiki:toc max_depth="4" />

=== Take Note ===

The DRMF# version will only work with the qlog.exe and does no longer need the DotA Replay Manager.

=== How it works ===

Drag a replay or a DRM/Qlog generated log file on it and you are ready to go!

=== Result Windows ===

   * Select lines via a normal, shift or ctrl click and click on the column header to copy the lines.
   * Double click anywhere on the listview to clear the clipboard.
   * The search is case sensitive. You can query for any keywords you want or select a player's name.

=== Drag & Drop ===

   * Drag a .txt file on the DRMF window to load the log content & the playerlist.
   * Drag and drop a .w3g file on the DRMF window to load the replay with qlog (and do the same as with the log.txt above).

=== Links & Paths ===

You can click on any website url or path to start/open it.

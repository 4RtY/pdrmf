#summary Readme for the project P

_Secret ENT staff tool for gathering information._

*Readme is currently under construction.*

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

=== Requirement ===
    * Internet Explorer must be installed (I suggest IE10)
    * (v1.3+) *You must have admin access on [https://entgaming.net/ ENT] to use the tool*

=== Errors ===
|| Your internet connection must be working. || Try to fix the connection or simply restart the GA ||
|| Internet Explorer isn't installed. || If IE isn't installed, do that or if the GA falsely judged that, set IEerror to 1 ||
|| Login failed. || Reasons: Wrong account/Password or no access to the admin site. Might as well be a tech issue - simply restart the tool to fix it. ||
|| Time out! || Loading of the game pages took too long. In that case make manually sure that the ENT page loads correctly. Sometimes, it might be an ENT problem, too. ||
